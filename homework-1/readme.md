## Assignment 1: Git Readme

### Websites vs Web Applications

Websites tend to focus on information. They are used to inform users about different topics, organizations, and events. When we go to a webpage, the browser loads HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

- HTML is used to define the content and layout of a page.
- CSS is used to style the pages; it controls the visual presentation.
- JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality.

### VS Code & Extensions

VS Code is where we write the code. For this course, we added different extensions, Prettier, Live Server, and Auto Rename Tag. To add extensions we need to click on the "Extensions" icon on the left side menu, then type the name of the extension we want.

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub

- Git is a control version system.
- GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.

### Markdown & Documentation

- Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed to format plain text in a way that can easily be converted to HTML.
