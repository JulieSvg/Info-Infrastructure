            <h2>A World Still Ruled by Dinosaurs</h2>
            <p>
              Imagine waking up to the sounds of massive, plant-eating dinosaurs
              roaming outside your window. Instead of birds chirping in the
              morning, you might hear the distant calls of Pterosaurs soaring
              through the sky. If the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs had
              missed Earth, evolution would have taken a vastly different path.
              Humanity might have grown alongside dinosaurs, forced to adapt to
              a world where towering Brachiosaurus shaped forests and apex
              predators like the T-Rex ruled the land. Would our cities have
              been built around these prehistoric giants, or would we have lived
              in enclosed spaces, fearing the danger of wild dinosaurs?
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps, over time, humans could have tamed certain species, using
              Triceratops as living bulldozers or riding raptors like horses.
              The presence of dinosaurs would have influenced everything, from
              architecture to agriculture, forcing us to create new ways of
              coexisting with creatures that once ruled the Earth. Would we be
              at the top of the food chain, or would dinosaurs still dominate
              the planet?

              <h2>How Dinosaurs Would Change the Ecosystem</h2>
              <p>
                If dinosaurs had survived, the entire ecosystem would look
                different. Large herbivores like Brachiosaurus would shape
                forests, eating massive amounts of vegetation, while apex
                predators like T-Rex would rule the food chain. Would we have
                domesticated some species for transportation or farming? Perhaps
                small, intelligent raptors could have been trained like dogs.
                The natural balance of our planet would be unrecognizable
                compared to what we see today.

              <h2>The Future: Can We Bring Dinosaurs Back?</h2>
              <p>
                With advances in genetic engineering, some scientists speculate
                that reviving dinosaurs might one day be possible. By extracting
                DNA from well-preserved fossils and manipulating the genetics of
                modern birds—dinosaurs' closest relatives—we may be able to
                recreate species that went extinct millions of years ago. But
                should we? A world with dinosaurs sounds fascinating, but it
                also raises ethical and ecological questions. Would these
                creatures have a place in today’s world, or would they struggle
                to survive in an environment no longer suited for them?
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether or not dinosaurs return, imagining a world where they
                never left gives us a glimpse into an alternate reality—one
                filled with towering giants, breathtaking ecosystems, and a
                completely different path for human civilization.
