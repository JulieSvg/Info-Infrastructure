## Assignment 1: Blog

### Blog Topic Summary

I decided to create a blog exploring what the world would be like if dinosaurs never went extinct. I chose this topic because Iâ€™ve always wondered how things might have evolved differently, and I thought it would be a fun idea to explore.

### Key Takeaways

- It is important to work with blocks from the start as it makes styling the page easier and more organized.
- Using section and div elements helps structure the content and apply styles effectively.
